I received a Ph.D degree in Computer Science from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk) at [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk). I was a member of the [COmputing Research for Impact on Lives (CORIL) Lab](http://bioinfo.cs.cityu.edu.hk) under the supervision of [Prof. Ka-Chun Wong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/kc.w.htm). From September 2022 till February 2023, I was a Visiting Research Fellow in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.cornell.edu) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu), working with [Prof. Sumanta Basu](https://compbio.cornell.edu/people/sumanta-basu) and [Prof. Martin Wells](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/martin-wells). My research interest spans data science and machine learning applications, especially for health, finance, and business analysis. Linked, is an example of my recent work on the optimization of machine learning algorithms for the precise diagnosis of metastatic cancer, determination of survival outcome, and treatment recommendation for improving the quality of life of patients ([sample paper](https://olutomilayo.github.io/files/Paper13.pdf)). I am majorly interested in applied machine learning, and deep learning. In 2017, I received my Masters degree in Computer Science at the [Faculty of Computing](https://engineering.utm.my/computing), [Universiti Teknologi Malaysia](https://utm.my) under the supervision of [Prof. Faisal Saeed](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/about-us/our-staff/faisal-saeed). I worked with machine learning algorithms and ensembles for the prediction of bioactive molecular compounds towards drug-target relationship ([sample paper](https://olutomilayo.github.io/files/Paper8.pdf)).

Professional Summary
======
I am a goal-oriented data scientist with over six years of experience in telling insightful stories with data. I am particularly drawn to high-impact fields of data science, hence my focus on Cancer research over the span of my graduate studies. Data is ubiquitous, and the methods of ploughing through it are numerous and ever-evolving. This presents a challenge that I embrace with excitement, both as a daily task and as a commitment to be on the cutting edge of the field. I am a happy learner, a keen observer and a firm believer that everything I do must be geared towards growth, contribution and impact.
