Traditionally, the west Africa subregion boast of some of the worldâ€™s healthiest diet, however, there is a gradual adoption of the high-calorie, high-fat, high-sodium and highly processed unhealthy foods from the western countries. This has been identified as a major cause of the increase in cases of diabetes, cancer and hypertension across Africa. In this study, we report factors that are responsible for this trend. Aggressive transatlantic promotional offerings which are leveraging on the growth of digital technology in the subregion has been a major enabler of this transition.
