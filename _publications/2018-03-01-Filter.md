This study utilised Filter-Wrapper combination and embedded (LASSO) feature selection methods on both high and low dimensional datasets before classification was 
performed. The results illustrate that the combination of filter and wrapper feature selection to create a hybrid form of feature selection provides better performance than using filter only. In addition, LASSO performed better on high dimensional data.
